<h3>Doctor Strange</h3>
<p>I really liked how a doctor, who by profession cannot believe in the existence of supernatural powers, protects the earth from evil forces using supernatural powers.</p>

<h3>Iron Man</h3>
<p>It is a very nice action movie.</p>

<h3>Avatar: The Way of Water</h3>
<p>I enjoyed aliens fighting in the water with humans.</p>
