<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Aryan Jaiswal and I am a 2nd year Computer Science student at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. Some of my hobbies
are playing Tennis, watching movies on Netflix, and listening to music. I love travelling to different places too.
</p>

<p>Me and my family are from India. I have a younger brother, Adi, who was born here. We lived in India for 6 years before we moved to the US in
2016. Currently, we live in a suburb in Illinois known as Buffalo Grove.

<p>When we were in India we lived in a residential area named Hiranandani Estate. If you want to contact me or just want to connect with me in
